Hey - I'm Andrew Bancroft (👉🏻data geek👈🏻).

I'm a born learner, passionate about discovery and about sharing new insights that come my way. 

Serving as the <a title="The Noble Research Institute, Inc." href="http://www.noble.org" target="_blank">Noble Research Institute's</a> Data Architect is one of my life's greatest joys. 

Dataday.life is my outlet for writing about databases, data modeling, and data science-y topics like machine learning. At [andrewcbancroft.com](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com) I nerd-out about iOS App development in Swift. Please keep in mind that <strong>this website, its content, and opinions are my own</strong>.

Teaching is also one of my passions. As an [Author for Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/andrew-bancroft), I've published a few courses to their library:

* ["Core Data Fundamentals with Swift"](http://bit.ly/ps-core-data-swift)
* ["Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods"](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cocoapods-xcode-project-dependencies)
