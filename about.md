Hey - I'm Andrew Bancroft.

I'm a born learner, passionate about discovery and about sharing new insights that come my way. 

I write here about data-related topics, and at [andrewcbancroft.com](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com) about iOS App development in Swift.

I serve as the <a title="The Noble Research Institute, Inc." href="http://www.noble.org" target="_blank">Noble Research Institute's</a> Data Architect. <strong>This website, its content, and opinions are my own</strong>.

I'm also a [Pluralsight Author](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/andrew-bancroft).  I've got two courses in the library now:

* ["Core Data Fundamentals with Swift"](http://bit.ly/ps-core-data-swift)
* ["Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods"](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cocoapods-xcode-project-dependencies)
