Question: How would you explain "data analytics" vs "data analysis"?

So what's the difference?

## Clues From the Suffix
They're extremely similar words... I mean, just the word-*ending* is different:  "-tic" vs "-sis" ("analytic**s**" is plural, so I used the singular)

Since the end of the word is where the difference lies (otherwise, there wouldn't be two terms, right?), why not go find out what each suffix might indicate?

### "-sis"
Here's something cool [from dictionary.com on the "-sis" suffix](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-sis):  

> "-sis" is a suffix that forms abstract nouns of action, process, state, condition, etc. from verbs

"-sis" noun-ifies verbs.  It takes the concept of action, process, state, condition that an "action word" like a verb might convey... and it transforms those into a [thing].

Come to think of it, "analysis" is sort of a verb-y noun, isn't it?  "We're going to *do* "data analysis"...", we say.  "Do" is the verb; "data analysis" is the noun. But there's a sense of action involved with data analysis, even if it's captured in this intangible, conceptual sense of a noun.

#### From the Definition
In dictioary terms, the word **analysis** encapsulates the idea of breaking something down.  It's the opposite of **synthesis**.  Synthesis is the process of composing separate things together into a new, combined [thing].  Analysis is the process of taking something and *de*composing it into its component parts.

Applied to data, then, analysis is the process of taking a data set apart, inspecting individual segments at a time, looking for the parts in the whole so that we can understand the information it contains.

### "-tic"
