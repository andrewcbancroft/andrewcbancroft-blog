"Analysis" and "analytics" are extremely similar words... I mean, just the word-*ending* is different:  "-sis" vs "-tics"

Since the end of the word is where the difference lies (otherwise, there wouldn't be two of them, right?), why not go find out what each suffix might indicate to get some clues as to what the difference between the words are?

I'm going to start with "analy**sis**".  Then I'm going to move to "analy**tic**".  The final stop before I make a summary conclusion will be the word "analyt**ics**".  

Let's go!

### "-sis"
Here's something cool [from dictionary.com on the "-sis" suffix](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-sis):  

> "-sis" is a suffix that forms abstract nouns of action, process, state, condition, etc. from verbs

"-sis" noun-ifies verbs.  It takes the concept of action, process, state, condition that an "action word" like a verb might convey... and it transforms those into a [thing].

Come to think of it, "analysis" is sort of a verb-y noun, isn't it?  "We're going to *do* "data analysis"...", we say.  "Do" is the verb; "data analysis" is the noun. But there's a sense of action involved with data analysis, even if it's captured in this intangible, conceptual sense of a noun.

#### From the Definition
In dictioary terms, the word **analysis** encapsulates the idea of breaking something down.  It's the opposite of **synthesis**.  Synthesis is the process of composing separate things together into a new, combined [thing].  Analysis is the process of taking something and *de*composing it into its component parts.

Applied to data, then, analysis is the process of taking a data set apart, inspecting individual segments at a time, looking for the parts in the whole so that we can understand the information it contains.

### "-tic"
Here's where it gets even cooler if you're a word nerd. Change "analytics" to "analytic" for me real quick...

Again, [from dictioary.com on the "-tic" suffix]([from dictionary.com on the "-sis" suffix](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-tic):

> a suffix forming *adjectives* from other parts of speech, *especially* in the formation of adjectives from nouns with stems in "-sis". equivalent in meaning to "-ic"

Here's the gist:  If you've got a "-sis" noun (like "analy**sis**"), you can make a descriptor word out if it by switching the word ending to "-tic".  And for all intents and purposes, "-tic" and "-ic" do exactly the same thing.

**Analysis**, the *noun*, becomes **Analytic**, an adjective.

#### From the Definition
"Analytic" as a definition isn't extremely interesting. It just means that whatever we're describing with the word "analytic" *has to do with analysis* (breaking something down), as opposed to synthesis (building something up).

### "-ics"
Let's switch "Anlytic" (the adjective) back to "Analytics".

Here, my friends, is where I thought things got super interesting.

> a suffix of nouns that denote a body of facts, knowledge, principles, etc., *usually corresponding to adjectives ending in -ic*

**boom**

Here we go:  Suppose you've got an adjective that has the ending "-ic" (analytic...which as we saw, basically just means "having something to do with analysis").  If you go from "-ic" to "-ic**s**", what happens?  You just noun-ified the adjective.  Ane *with* that noun-ification, you've brought new connotations to the word.  Suddenly there's a sense of encapsulating a body of facts, knowledge, principles, and so on.

**Analytics** then, denotes the body of facts, knowledge, principles, etc of **analysis**.  Analytics is the **science of analysis**.  It encompases the corpus of understanding we have about analytis...about the processes and principles for breaking things down.
