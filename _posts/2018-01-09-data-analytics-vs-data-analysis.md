Question: How would you explain "data analytics" vs "data analysis"?

They're extremely similar words... I mean, just the word-*ending* is different:  "-tics" vs "-sis".

So what's the difference?

## Clues From the Suffix
Since the end of the word is where the difference lies (otherwise, there wouldn't be two terms, right?), why not go find out what each suffix might indicate?

### "-sis"
Here's something cool [from dictionary.com on the "-sis" suffix](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-sis):  

> "-sis" is a suffix that forms abstract nouns of action, process, state, condition, etc. from verbs

"-sis" noun-ifies verbs.  It takes the concept of action, process, state, condition... and it transforms those into a [thing].

"I'm doing to *do* "data analysis"...", we say.  "Do" is the verb; "data anslysis" is the noun. 

There's a sense of action involved with data analysis, even if it's captured in this intangible, conceptual sense of a noun.

### "-tics"
