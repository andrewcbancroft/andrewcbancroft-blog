It's a fair question: Is [dimensional modeling](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-a-dimensional-model/) still relevant in the age of big data?

Read enough about "big data", and you may start to get the impression that modeling techniques are old-fashioned or irrelevant.

Data professionals in IT departments are used to wrangling data - it's understood that there's no "easy button" when it comes to integrating data and geting meaning out of it.  So we muster the energy and we do what it takes to get the data in order for [whatever analysis](https://www.dataday.life/what-types-of-data-analysis-are-there/) the business is after.

But guess what:  **Business users don't want to wrangle data.**

Not even savvy business users want to go through the trouble of writing map-reduce jobs or doing the work necessary to produce predictive models.

What do business users want? **Self-service** analysis capability in a context they understand.
* They don't want to write code or queries
* They don't want to be left integrating data sets themselves
* They don't want to understand infrastructure

They want the information that can help them make a business decision without lots of hoops to jump through (including work orders for reports to IT).

That's why I believe there are at least 5 reasons that dimensional models can be a huge win for the business and for IT.
