There's a strong temptation to equate "predictive analytics" and "machine learning". It's not uncommon to throw the terms around interchangeably, which signals that the two are strongly related.

But is there a *difference* that sometimes gets lost when we substitute one term for the other? If there *is* a difference, is it important to distinguish? Is it dangerous or misleading to use the terms as synonyms?

## Questions -> Data -> Analysis -> Answers
This flow is what it's all about, isn't it?  At the end of the day, you want *answers* so that you can take informed action.

But before you can get **answers**, you need to do a certain kind of **analysis**.

But before you do *analysis*, you need **data** to perform the analysis on.

But before you bother with *data*, you typically have **questions** in mind.  

You're curious about the world, your industry, your process. You make observations and you wonder if doing [something] will impact or *change* [something else] that would lead to [some goal]. 

In order to satisfy your curiosity, you collect [data](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/) in the form of [quantitative](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#quantitative-numerical) and [qualitative](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#qualitative-categorical) measurements. 

The data fuels the possibility for analysis, so that hopefully, you walk away with a more complete picture than you had before (ie, you have answers).

## Kinds of Data Analysis
There are at least six kinds of analysis that can be performed on a data set:

1. Descriptive Analysis
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Inferential Analysis
4. Predictive Analysis
5. Causal Analysis
6. Mechanistic Analysis

I've made [more detailed observations](https://www.dataday.life/what-kinds-of-data-analysis-are-there/) about each one of these six categories of analysis separately.  What I want you to notice about the list above is what *is* and *isn't* listed.

"Predictive Analysis" made the list at #4, but "Machine Learning" didn't.  Why?

## The Difference
Predictive analytics and machine learning are not "the same". 

Machine learning is *a way to do* predictive analytics. Machine learning is a means to another end, namely, to predict measurement(s) for specific "units"/individuals in a population, based on a sample data set from that population.

Predictive analytics seeks to make estimations about specific people (or specific animals or widgets or [whatever] the "unit" of interest is from your population of "units").  We want to be able to ask things like, "Which specific customers are more likely to purchase [this product] if we run [this marketing campaign] targeted at them?" or "What is a likely selling price for [this house]?" or any number of other questions that [fit the pattern](https://www.dataday.life/patterns-and-key-words-of-predictive-analytics-questions/) for predictive analytics to provide the answer for.

Machine learning just happens to be *one way* to accomplish the goal of predictive analytics.

## Before There Were Machines to Learn
Before there were machines, there were... *people*.

People have been doing predictive analysis for decades. It may have taken longer and been more tedius and error-prone, but steps that are taken to figure out "the answer" in machine learning have been do-able by humans for a long time... they are not "new".

Sooooo... why "machine learning"? In short, it's a *scale* problem with modern data sets. The data sets of the 21st century are much larger than ever before in history. 

While it's *possible* for people to compute the outputs that a machine learning algorithm can produce, it's *unnecessary*.  Due to the scale of data in today's world, it's also insanely impractical for many data sets.
