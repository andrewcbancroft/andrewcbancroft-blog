There's a strong temptation to equate "predictive analytics" and "machine learning". It's not uncommon to throw the terms around interchangeably, which signals that the two are strongly related.

But is there a *difference* that sometimes gets lost when we substitute one term for the other? If there *is* a difference, is it important to distinguish? Is it dangerous or misleading to use the terms as synonyms?

## Questions -> Data -> Analysis -> Answers
This flow is what it's all about, isn't it?  At the end of the day, you want *answers* so that you can take informed action.

But before you can get **answers**, you need to do a certain kind of **analysis**.

But before you do *analysis*, you need **data** to perform the analysis on.

But before you bother with *data*, you typically have **questions** in mind.  

You're curious about the world, your industry, your process. You make observations and you wonder if doing [something] will impact or *change* [something else] that would lead to [some goal]. 

In order to satisfy your curiosity, you collect [data](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/) in the form of [quantitative](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#quantitative-numerical) and [qualitative](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#qualitative-categorical) measurements. 

The data fuels the possibility for analysis, so that hopefully, you walk away with a more complete picture than you had before (ie, you have answers).
