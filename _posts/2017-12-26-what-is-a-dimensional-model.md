## Measurements and Descriptions
There are endless ways to measure and describe the world around us.

When you boil [data](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/) down to the essentials, what you get are...

1. Measurement(s)
2. Descriptions of the measurement(s)

It doesn't matter what industry you're in. It doesn't matter the process that captured the data you're looking at. At the end of the day, you've got *[numbers](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#quantitative-numerical) and [classifications](https://www.dataday.life/what-is-data-like-im-five/#qualitative-categorical)* as measurements, and you've got the *context* describing the *who, what, when, where, why, and how* of those measurements.

## "Dimensional Model" - Breaking it Down
Let's unpack the term "dimensional model" to see if we can make heads of tails of what the words mean when they're put together in this term.

I'll start with the noun (model) and then look at the adjective (dimensional).

### Model
What's a *model*?

The first images that come to mind for me involve cars, trains, and rocket ships.  When you think about the hobby of model-making, what you have is an activity where you take [something] (like a car, train, or rocket) and create [something else] that *represents* the original (the model).

Let's keep that word:  **represent**

Another image that comes to mind is a *person* who is a model. You think about the man or woman walking down the runway, showing off what a particular designer's outfit should look like on an "ideal" person.

Let's keep that word too:  **ideal**

The world is complicated. Sometimes, in order to shut out the noise, we create something that portrays the *general concept* of something that would otherwise be difficult to understand.

**General concept** is the last word we'll keep for now.

So what do we have?

> A model is a **representation** of data that portrays its **general concept(s)**, in a way that is **ideal** for understanding the patterns and information the data contains.

<a name="kind-of-model"></a>
That last part, "ideal for understanding the patterns and information the data contains" leaves the door open to the possibility that there might be different *kinds* of models that are more or less ideal for different analyses.

The first half remains true to all models.  Models are representations of data.  And models boil things down to the general concept(s) that exist within the data.

### Dimensional
What does the word "dimension" being to mind for you?

I immediately thought of shapes (2 *dimensional* or 3 *dimensional* shapes).

In a 2D shape, the "dimensions" are length and width, aren't they?  A square or rectangle has sides that are [x] units long by [y] units wide.  3D shapes add a dimension:  depth.

In the case of shapes, a "dimension" is [the thing] that answers the question "how long?" or "how wide?" or "how deep?".

Outside the world of geometry, the word "dimension" carries the idea of the characteristics and qualities of something.
