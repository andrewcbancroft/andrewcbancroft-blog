# Decisions, Decisions

My decision journal entry from August 31, 2017 reads as follows:

**Decision**: "Accept position as Data Architect"

**Mental / Physical State**:
  * Energized
  * Focused
  * Anxious

Deciding what you want to be when you grow up is hard, isn't it?

I've teetered between two realms in my career:  Data, and software development, and now, as of August 31, data again.

Spending four years in each camp has given me two perspectives on the world that I trust will prove valuable as I endeavor to enable the [Noble Research Institute](https://www.noble.org) to utilize data to our every advantage in [solving great agricultural challenges](https://www.noble.org/about/).

# Software Development Takeaways
Two things stick out to me as I transition from a career in building apps to a career in to orchestrating optimal data utilization for our Institute:

1. Programming skills are vital to data science
Had I never become a software developer, I'd have an even steeper mountain before me to climb. Being in software development has exposed me to numerous programming languages, including C#, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, and Python, to name the most-frequently used.  I've explored multiple programming paradigms:  object-oriented, of course, but I've also dabbled in functional languages like Haskell and Scala.

While I definitely expect to be a pragmatic *practicioner* of data science (as opposed to being, say, a developer of new machine learning algorithms), having exposure to ways in which to think about and assemble programming logic should ground me.

2. Software is a means to an end (not an end in itself)
What do I mean by "a means to an end"?

In my observation, most software exists to support critical functions of a business.  That's certainly the case for the kind of software I was involved in developing.

Most software enhances operational processes.. tracks critical steps in a pipeline of business activities.

Most software exists to acquire...*data*.

Data is one stage closer to the final "end" goal, which is to have the ability to know with some confidence what we should do *next*.
