Hey I'm Andrew Bancroft.

I'm a born learner, passionate about discovery and about sharing new insights that come my way. I blog here about all things software development with a primary emphasis on [iOS development in Swift][1], and [.Net development in C#][2]. [Dataday.life][3] is my outlet for writing about all things data.


Teaching is also one of my passions. As an [Author for Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/andrew-bancroft), I've published a few courses to their library:

* [iOS Debugging Fundamentals](http://bit.ly/ios-debugging-fundamentals)
* [iOS Data Persistence: The BigPicure](http://bit.ly/ios-data-persistence-bp)
* [CloudKit Fundamentals](http://bit.ly/cloudkit-fundamentals)
* [Core Data Fundamentals with Swift](http://bit.ly/ps-core-data-swift)
* [Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cocoapods-xcode-project-dependencies)

Please keep in mind that <strong>this website, its content, and opinions are my own</strong>.

I'd love it if you connect with me on <a title="twitter.com/andrewcbancroft" href="https://twitter.com/andrewcbancroft">Twitter</a>, <a title="GitHub - andrewcbancroft" href="https://github.com/andrewcbancroft" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or <a title="Youtube - andrewcbancroft" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPV9kMhP-b5EFRI7d812pg">YouTube</a>!
