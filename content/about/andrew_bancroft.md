Hey - I'm Andrew Bancroft.

I'm a born learner, passionate about discovery and about sharing new insights that come my way.

[Dataday.life](https://www.dataday.life) is my outlet for writing about all things data.

At [andrewcbancroft.com](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com) I nerd out about iOS App development in Swift. 

Teaching is also one of my passions. As an [Author for Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/andrew-bancroft), I've published a few courses to their library:

* [iOS Data Persistence: The BigPicure](http://bit.ly/ios-data-persistence-bp)
* [CloudKit Fundamentals](http://bit.ly/cloudkit-fundamentals)
* [Core Data Fundamentals with Swift](http://bit.ly/ps-core-data-swift)
* [Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cocoapods-xcode-project-dependencies)

Please keep in mind that <strong>this website, its content, and opinions are my own</strong>.
