I had TypeScript files building and running perfectly when I'd debug locally, but when I changed over to publish the project, I got build errors galore:

> Cannot find module \___
> 
> TS6053 â€“ File \___ not found 

I had forgotten that I set up my TypeScript Build configuration for _Debug_, but I hadn't changed anything for the _Release_ configuration in Visual Studio.

Obviously, that would produce different build results, right? It was just a little mysterious to me until I noticed the configuration differences.

If you're running into similar errors when building / publishing your project using the Release configuration, right-click your ASP.Net web project, go down to TypeScript Build, and make sure that your configuration settings are the same between Debug and Release. In particular, my &#8220;Module System&#8221; settings were different until I adjusted things.
