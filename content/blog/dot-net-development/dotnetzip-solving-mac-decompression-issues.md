As part of a ASP.Net Web API service that I'm co-developing, I have gotten familiar with the <a title="DotNetZip Codeplex Page" href="http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">DotNetZip Library</a>.&nbsp; It's fantastic.&nbsp; We're using it to gather up a set of requested files from network storage, package them in a zip archive, and stream them back to a client via a web application.

During testing, things worked great on Windows machines, but the moment we tested using a Mac, we ran into issues.

## Synopsis:

Problem:&nbsp; On a Mac, a zip file would be downloaded, but it could not be extracted.&nbsp; Double-clicking the zip file resulted in the creation of a .cpgz file.

Solution:&nbsp; In ASP.Net code, change

HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = &#8220;application/zip&#8221;

to

HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = &#8220;application/octet-stream&#8221;

## Problem Details:

A zip archive would download as normal, but as things were wrapping up, Safari would try to decompress the file and it would fail.

Error from Safari's download manager area:

Furthermore, when attempting to simply extract the files directly using the built in Mac Archive Utility (by double-clicking the zip file), the utility would actually re-archive the file, rather than extract it.&nbsp; The end result was the creation of a .cpgz file.&nbsp; Attempting to decompress _that_ file would result in creating another .zip file, which, when double-clicked, created another .cpgz file, and so on, and so on.

Archive Utility re-archiving the zip file when double-clicked (rather than _un_-archiving it)

Creation of .cpgz file:

Needless to say, the solution to this problem, though somewhat mysterious, was quite simple for me.

In my ASP.Net code, I was writing the zip file to the Response OutputStream.&nbsp; I had added a content type of &#8220;application/zip&#8221; to the response.&nbsp; This is what was breaking the zip files on a Mac.&nbsp; Buried <a title="DotNetZip Library Forum" href="http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/discussions/59740" target="_blank">in the DotNetZip Library's forum was a post</a> recommending changing the content type to &#8220;application/octet-stream&#8221; instead.&nbsp; That single changed fixed the issue for standard zip files!

## Solution Details:

Change

HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = &#8220;application/zip&#8221;

to

HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = &#8220;application/octet-stream&#8221;
