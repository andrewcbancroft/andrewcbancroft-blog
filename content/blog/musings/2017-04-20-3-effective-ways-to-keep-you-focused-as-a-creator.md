# Away with the Phone!

Put your phone away. Far away.

Not in your pocket.

Not on your desk.

**In a drawer** &#8211; _away_ from you.

_Disconnect_.

You should be able to tell if you&#8217;ve got an emergency call coming in, but past that, aim to be completely oblivious to every other kind of notification flowing into your smart device.

If you use a time management technique like [Pomodoro][1] (there are plenty of timers and apps in the app store to keep you on track with this strategy), you get 5 minutes every half hour to pause from making awesome stuff. Use _that_ time to get up, stretch, and, if you must, check your phone.

Being able to easily reach my phone is a _huge_, huge productivity killer.

I&#8217;ve started putting it in a drawer with the ringer on at a reasonable volume level so as not to miss an emergency. Life has been much more productive since.

# Music to Code By

Putting your phone away minimizes physical distractions from your environment.

[Music to Code By][2] minimizes _mental_ distractions and keeps you focused.

Don&#8217;t be mislead by the title. It&#8217;s not just for programmers!

If you need to write, organize, or just _think_ in general, I highly recommend this invaluable resource.

The problem I always have with music when it comes to productivity is that&#8230;

  * The music has words and I wanna sing! (sorry, teammates)
  * The music is too mellow and causes me to want to sleep.
  * The music is too up-beat or interesting&#8230; interesting enough to distract me.

[Music to Code By][2] is literally the Goldilocks of music for concentration purposes. No words. Not too slow. Not too fast or &#8220;interesting&#8221;. **Just right**.

I bought the [original 3 tracks][3], and it&#8217;s been the best $18 I&#8217;ve spent to improve my focus.

I know what you&#8217;re thinking: I have to spend money??!

Well, you&#8217;d spend money to buy a hammer or a saw if you needed to build something, wouldn&#8217;t you?

You&#8217;d drop a few dollars on an app if you knew it&#8217;d be worth it for the job you needed it to do, right?

Think of Music to Code By as a tool for your brain&#8217;s focus&#8230; a &#8220;clamp&#8221; if you will, to keep you riveted on what you need to accomplish.

If you can&#8217;t afford $20 right now, can you afford $10? Save for two months and _then_ buy it!

I haven&#8217;t encountered any other tool apart from these sound tracks that I can spend dollars on that keeps me focused.

Full disclosure: No one paid me to say all that. I&#8217;ve really just been _that impacted_ by the product that I couldn&#8217;t keep from commending it to you.

# Keep a Text Editor Window Open (but minimized)

Whenever a distracting thought comes to mind, open the text editor and jot down the thought.

&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve got to remember to call \___&#8221;&#8230;

  * Open Text editor window &#8211;> 
  * Type &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to call \___&#8221; &#8211;> 
  * Minimize &#8211;> 
  * Back to making great things!

&#8220;Blog post idea!&#8221;&#8230;

  * Open Text editor window &#8211;> 
  * Type &#8220;[Blog post idea]&#8221; &#8211;> 
  * Minimize &#8211;> 
  * Continue that awesome project!

Always have a text editor window open and ready to record _whatever_ your random ramblings may be. Your mind can effectively &#8220;let go&#8221; because you just preserved what it alerted you to in the text file.

Don&#8217;t keep the window on the screen all the time though. You&#8217;ll be tempted to glance over at it too often. Jot down the thought and then minimize it.

Oh. And be sure to _save_ the file. :]

# What do _you_ do?

These are my top three right now. What do _you_ do to keep focused on what matters?
