There is a lot to know. A _lot_.

I happen to be one of those individuals who gets geeked out very, very often over very, very nerdy things.

As of late I&#8217;ve been really wanting an outlet to share what I&#8217;ve learned / am learn_ing._ The world doesn&#8217;t need another blog detailing the same things that are already out there &#8211; at least not a verbatim copy of information that&#8217;s available already.

But the thing I&#8217;ve figured out is that everybody has a slant on how they glean understanding on something that&#8217;s unique to them. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve read multiple blogs full of code or with a perspective on an idea and sort of used the combination of them all to come up with a better understanding on \___ topic that ends up working for me.

I recently read a tweet from Scott Hanselman  
[here][1] that caused something to just click in my mind: he encouraged blogging rather than emailing. This makes sense &#8211; emails and other forms of direct communication have limited potential for helping effect. A blog post and an email with a link to the blog post has much greater potential for impact.

And then I took that and theorized about what could be possible if I just had an outlet to share what I&#8217;ve run across, because you never know when you might have the answer someone was looking for &#8211; they just needed you to share it in your own unique way that spoke to their particular scheme of processing information.

So here&#8217;s to hoping that maybe possibly somehow someday someone will find something of interest somewhere in this blog of mine. For now i foresee posts about some of the following:

  1. Thoughts on code that I&#8217;m learning / writing
  2. Stuff about SQL Server and Business Intelligence
  3. Discoveries from other realms of study
  4. Tutorials on things I&#8217;ve figured out and think might help someone someday
  5. Thoughts / reactions / responses to news
  6. Who knows what else&#8230;
