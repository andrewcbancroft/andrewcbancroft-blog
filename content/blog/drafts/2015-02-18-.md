### Test Context

The first step to get set up for integration testing is to create a test `DbContext`. For my own integration tests, I simply create a `DbContext` subclass that looks a lot like my _real_ `DbContext` subclass, only with a few minor tweaks.

If my real `DbContext` looks like this:

<pre class="theme:vs2012 lang:c# decode:true " title="RealDbContext" >using System.Data.Entity;

public class MyRealDbContext : DbContext
{
    public RealDbContext()
        : base("name=ConnectionStringNameFromConfigFile")
    {
    }

    public virtual IDbSet&lt;Something> Somethings { get; set; }
}
</pre>

My TestDbContext might look something like _this_:

<pre class="theme:vs2012 lang:c# decode:true " title="TestDbContext" >using MainProject.ModelsNamespace;
using System.Data.Entity;

public class TestDbContext : DbContext
{
    public TestDbContext()
        : base()
    {
        this.Configuration.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;
    }

    public virtual IDbSet&lt;Something&gt; Somethings { get; set; }
}</pre>

#### Observations

  * Since my integration tests are in a different project within my solution, I need to add a using statement to import the namespace for my model object(s).
  * Notice that TestDbContext inherits from `DbContext`, and _not_ my `RealDbContext`. This is because I don&#8217;t want to be connecting to the same database as my `RealDbContext`&#8230; rather, I want to use one that&#8217;s local for my integration tests (we&#8217;ll configure this momentarily)
  * Lazy loading of related entities is turned _off_. One particular area this is useful is if you have requirements for and want to test that .Include() is explicitly called in order to fetch related entities. This is optional, depending on your needs, but for my own needs, this was a helpful thing to disable for my integration tests.

### Test Initializer

Once I&#8217;ve got a TestDbContext ready to go, I can create an IntegrationTestInitializer that inherits from DropCreateDatabaseAlways<TestDbContext>. I can then seed that database (which will be dropped and recreated for each test run). Note that if you need it to be dropped, recreated, and reseeded before each _integration test_, [StackOverflow has a nice answer on how to do that][1].

The IntegrationTestInitializer could look something like this:

<pre class="theme:vs2012 lang:c# decode:true " title="IntegrationTestInitializer" >using MainProject.ModelsNamespace;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Data.Entity;

public class IntegrationTestInitializer : DropCreateDatabaseAlways&lt;TestDbContext&gt;
{
    protected override void Seed(TestDbContext context)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
        {
            context.Somethings.Add(new Something
            {
                SomeID = i,
                SomeProperty = "Some value",
                Widgets = new List&lt;Widget>{new Widget()}
            });
        }

        context.SaveChanges();
    }
}</pre>

#### Observations

  * You can obviously add however many of whatever you want to add to the database. Whatever makes the most sense to get you rolling with being able to query predictable data, so that you can verify what you need to in your integration tests.
  * Make sure to call context.SaveChanges() after you&#8217;ve added things to all of your context&#8217;s DbSets.

### Integration Tests

We&#8217;re now set to create integration tests using Entity Framework 6! Below is an example test (I&#8217;m using XUnit). Assuming that Somethings have a navigation property called Widget, I could test that .Include() was called by doing something like this:

<pre class="theme:vs2012 lang:c# decode:true " title="Integration Test" >using MainProject.ModelsNamespace;
using System.Data.Entity;
using System.Linq;
using Xunit;

[Trait("Test Category", "Integration")]
[Fact]
public void IncludesWidgetsWithSomethings()
{
    Database.SetInitializer(new IntegrationTestInitializer());
    var context = new TestDbContext();
    context.Database.Initialize(true);

    var thingThatUsesDbContext = new ThingThatUsesDbContext(context);
    var result = thingThatUsesDbContext.FetchSomethingsWithWidgets();

    Assert.NotNull(result.Somethings.FirstOrDefault().Widgets);
}</pre>

#### Observations

  * I&#8217;m specifying that my database&#8217;s initializer will be a new IntegrationTestInitializer (which will drop, recreate, and reseed the local database being used for this test)
  * I&#8217;m creating a new instance of a TestDbContext, and telling it to initialize the database.
  * I&#8217;ve got to pass the TestDbContext instance off to the thing that uses a `DbContext` of some sort. This obviously presupposes that ThingThatUsesDbContext has been designed with a constructor that allows a `DbContext` to be passed in, so that I can inject the kind of `DbContext` I need (a test one for my tests, and a real one for the live app).
  * Since lazy loading is turned _off_ (see TestDbContext above), Widgets will only be non-null if .Include() is called somewhere within FetchSomethingsWithWidgets().
