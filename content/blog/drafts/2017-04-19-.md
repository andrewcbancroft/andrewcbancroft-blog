# Divide and Conquer

When you can&#8217;t seem to find motivation because the task or project is large and daunting, or the amount of time it&#8217;ll take seems overwhelming, divide it in half!

Still too much? Divide it in half again!

Keep dividing until what&#8217;s in front of you feels like something you can accomplish.

Project has 4 parts? Aim to finish 2. If that&#8217;s still too many, aim to finish 1. Can the single part be divided into parts? Keep dividing until you&#8217;ve got a chunk that you say, &#8220;Ok, now _that_ I can do.&#8221;

When you reach one of your halfway points, you&#8217;ll be that much more energized to do the next half!
