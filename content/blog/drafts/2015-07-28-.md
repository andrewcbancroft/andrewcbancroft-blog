Quick is an awesome behavior-driven development testing framework. It goes above and beyond XCTest in its ability to clearly communicate the purpose of a given test, and in the feedback it can provide out of the box when a test fails. Additionally, Quick steers you in the right direction with your tests, with a clear emphasis on verifying _behavior_ of your app, over testing _code implementation_.

So Quick is wonderful â€“ but getting started with it can be a little daunting if you're timid around the Terminal. Installing Quick and getting things set up in your Xcode project means dropping into the Terminal and running some commands for either a CocoaPods or a Carthage installation. But of course, that assumes you _have_ CocoaPods or Carthage installed. If you don't, then you also need to either install CocoaPods using their command line snippet, or install Homebrew to install Carthage, which again means Terminal time!

My goal in this guide is to alleviate some of that timidness when it comes to getting Quick configured in your Xcode project.
