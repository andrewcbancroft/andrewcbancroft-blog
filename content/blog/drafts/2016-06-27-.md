When using Core Data, there is a situation that one needs to be aware of when it comes to memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC): Relationships.

Specifically, _inverse_ relationships. Whenever you set up your data model so that a relationship can be traversed in both directions, you&#8217;ll want to be aware of the possibility of a reference cycle. I&#8217;ll show you how that situation could arise and provide you a way to break the reference cycle and avoid a memory leak in your app!

# Inverse relationships

Setting up inverse relationships in your data model provides a really convenient way to navigate to related `NSManagedObjects`, but it just so happens that setting them up introduces the possibility of creating a strong reference cycle between the two objects, thus creating a memory leak in your app.

If you need to know a little more about Automatic Reference Counting, [I&#8217;ve written a piece on that][1] for your enjoyment and edification. ðŸ™‚

It&#8217;s not critical that you understand all the mechanics of ARC. Rather, it&#8217;s important to pay attention to how the strong reference cycle can occur, and how to break it if need be.

I&#8217;ll be using my &#8220;Zootastic&#8221; data model for this example ([full source and working example available on GitHub][2]).

Supposing that you have a data model that looks like this:

The relationship we&#8217;ll be inspecting for this article is the one between an `Animal` and its `Classification`.

# How the strong reference cycle occurs

Imagine that we have a list of all the `Classification`s in our data store (think table view). Tapping on one of those `Classification`s would list out all the `Animal` instances that are related to the `Classification`.

So from the first view controller to the second, you have a `prepareForSegue` set up to pass the
