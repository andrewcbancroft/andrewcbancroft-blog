Step away from inferential statistics for a while and the interpretation of Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing could slip away.

How about a mnemonic to help solidify the concepts?

To frame the mnemonic, consider the following scenario:

A man has been charged with murder and you're on the jury.  Witnesses have brought forth testimony.  Evidence has been submitted.  And now... you've handed in your verdict.

Now for the mnemonic.

> If he's going to jail but shouldn't be<br>you've committed an error<br>of the 1st degree (Type I)<br><br>on the *other* hand<br><br>If you set him free when he's<br>actually guilty<br>your evidence was too few<br>and you've committed a Type II.
