## Persistence prevails: Dave shares his iOS developer journey

After watching [Dave Jacobsen's](https://twitter.com/davejacobseniOS) story on YouTube, I found myself asking, "When would *I* have given up if I were in Dave's shoes?"

He shares about the sobering reality of how much effort and dedication it really takes to transition careers.  But he also proves it's possible if you persist!

## Core ML brings the beauty of braille to the seeing

How cool is this? [Aaron Stephenson](https://twitter.com/azzoor) is learning braile. He's also a developer.

What does he do to check himself to make sure he's reading things correctly? He trains a Core ML model to recognize braile letters and display them using augmented reality.

Beautiful.

## Streamlined XCTestCase Template

[Jon Reid](https://twitter.com/qcoding) is an amazing teacher of testing. I came across his [Streamlined XCTestCase Template](https://qualitycoding.org/swift-unit-testing-template/) this week and had to share.

## Ship something. Anything.

I agree with [Eduardo](https://twitter.com/edouard_iosdev) and [Jeff](https://twitter.com/JeffMorhous).  

Perfection is overrated.  Ship something.  Anything.  Then improve it over time!
