"Declarative" is one of Swift UI's four core principles.

Aside from taking for granted that declarative is just "better" than *whatever else*, how about a visual to understand the declarative way of thinking?

Imagine yourself in a restaurant (sit-down or fast food, whichever).

When you want a burger, which best describes what you do?

or...

Saying **what** you want (aka, being "declarative") is what the most probable thing you'd do in a restaurant.

That's exactly the recipe you use when you're working with SwiftUI.
