Once you've [passed an NSManagedObjectContext instance to your SwiftUI View](/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/using-core-data-with-swiftui-introduction/), you'll need to pull data out of your Core Data persistent store with a fetch request.

## First Things First
* The remainder of this how-to assumes that you've already got a way to initialize the Core Data stack. Ticking the 'Use Core Data' checkbox when you start a new app will place some boilerplate code in `AppDelegate`.
* `@Environment(\.managedobjectcontext)` must [be assigned](/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/passing-nsmanagedobjectcontext-to-swiftui-view/) before the View is initialized for `@FetchRequest` to work.
* Code examples are taken from my "Blog Idea List" sample project that includes a single Core Data Entity named `BlogIdea`:

You can refer to my [introduction to using Core Data with SwiftUI](/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/using-core-data-with-swiftui-introduction/) to review all of the steps in one spot.  It includes an example project with all of the pieces stitched together!

## Breaking Down the Code
There are three key components to this:

1. A way to configure an `NSFetchRequest` *with* an `NSSortDescriptor` added. Your app will blow up üí• if you don't have one added to your fetch request.
2. The `@FetchRequest` property wrapper in your SwiftUI view.
3. A SwiftUI View that displays the results of the executed fetch request.

The following code snippets provide you an example of how to weave all three components together.

Comments with ‚ùáÔ∏è symbols will explain the details inline.

**BlogIdea.swift**
{{< highlight swift "linenos=table" >}}
import Foundation
import CoreData

// ‚ùáÔ∏è BlogIdea code generation is turned OFF in the xcdatamodeld file
public class BlogIdea: NSManagedObject, Identifiable {
    @NSManaged public var ideaTitle: String?
    @NSManaged public var ideaDescription: String?
}

extension BlogIdea {
    // ‚ùáÔ∏è The @FetchRequest property wrapper in the ContentView will call this function
    static func allIdeasFetchRequest() -> NSFetchRequest<BlogIdea> {
        let request: NSFetchRequest<BlogIdea> = BlogIdea.fetchRequest() as! NSFetchRequest<BlogIdea>
        
        // ‚ùáÔ∏è The @FetchRequest property wrapper in the ContentView requires a sort descriptor
        request.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "ideaTitle", ascending: true)]
          
        return request
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}

**ContentView.swift**

{{< highlight swift "linenos=table" >}}
import SwiftUI

struct SwiftUIView: View {
    // ‚ùáÔ∏è The BlogIdea class has an `allIdeasFetchRequest` function that can be used here
    @FetchRequest(fetchRequest: BlogIdea.allIdeasFetchRequest()) var blogIdeas: FetchedResults<BlogIdea>

    var body: some View {
        List(self.blogIdeas) { blogIdea in
            Text(blogIdea.ideaTitle ?? "")
        }
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}

 Note that you don't actually need to hold a reference to the `@Environment`'s `managedObjectContext`.

 `@Environment`'s `managedObjectContext` must be set! But you don't have to "call" it or use it directly to make the fetch request "go".


## Where's the Call to Perform the Fetch Request?
With most Core Data apps, you're going to see a call to `fetch(_:)` somewhere in your code.

This happens "behind the scenes" when you use the `@FetchRequest` property wrapper in your SwiftUI view. No need to use your managed object context to perform the fetch request manually.
