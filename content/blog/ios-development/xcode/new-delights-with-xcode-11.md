Xcode 11 has a few new shinies that are delightful (to me).  This running list is here for you to notice and (hopefully) enjoy as well.

## Capabilities Search
In your project settings, you can search for capabilities you want to add (instead of scrolling down the list and turning things "on" or "off").

## Marks
Have you noticed that `// Mark:` produces "header"-like text in the minimap?

`// Mark:` also produces a thin line break in your code - I think it definitely helps spot divisions in your code and could help find what you want a little quicker.

## Source Control in Inspectors Pane
There's a little source control icon in the Inspectors pane that lets you quickly see commit history and perform quick actions.
