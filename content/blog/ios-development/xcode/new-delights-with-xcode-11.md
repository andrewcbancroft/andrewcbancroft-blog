Xcode 11 has a few new shinies that are delightful (to me).  This running list is here for you to notice and (hopefully) enjoy as well.

## Capabilities Search
In your project settings, you can search for capabilities you want to add (instead of scrolling down the list and turning things "on" or "off").

## Editor Quick Actions
Holding the `command` key down while mousing over and clicking on various levels of your code presents a quick action pop-out.  Handy!

## Marks in the Minimap
Have you noticed that `// Mark:` produces "header"-like text in the minimap?

`// Mark:` also produces a thin line break in your code - I think it definitely helps spot divisions in your code and could help find what you want a little quicker.

## Jump to Code from Minimap
The minimap in and of itself is nice, but I found the "jump to code" features smart and convenient.

## History Inspector (source control history)
There's a little source control icon in the Inspectors pane that lets you quickly see commit history and perform quick actions.
