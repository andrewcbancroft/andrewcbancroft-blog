## Where's the Live View?
So you've created a new Single View playground from the template picker...

You run the playground right out of the gate to see what you've got...

But... Where's the Live View?

## Showing the Live View
To get the live view to show up, you need to **open the Assitant Editor**.

You can do this by clicking `View` - `Assistant Editor` - `Show Assistant Editor`.

Or you can press `option` + `command` + `return` to show it.

And we're off to play!
