Full credit to [Russell Ivanovic][1] for his [tweet][2] for figuring out how to disable Xcode 8's extremely chatty debug console logging. I just wanted this here for my own reference, but perhaps it's helpful to you as well.

If you're tired of sifting through operating system-level logging to the debug console while you're debugging your app, it's actually fairly easy to silence.

1. Edit the scheme for your app:

<a name="new-environment-variable" class="jump-target"></a>  
2. In the &#8216;Run' section, click on &#8216;Arguments' tab, and add a new Environment Variable. Use `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` for the name, and `disable` for the value:  
[<img src="https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DataHelper_swift-4.png" alt="New Environment Variable" width="895" height="506" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13068" srcset="https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DataHelper_swift-4.png 895w, https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DataHelper_swift-4-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" />][4]

That's it! Closing the Scheme editor and re-running your app will produce a beautifully silent console window, leaving you free to see what you wanted to see with `print()`, or other app-specific info (such as runtime exceptions) without having to sift through all that OS-level logging.
