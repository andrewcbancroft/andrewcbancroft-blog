In my recent <a title="Clean Coding in Swift â€“ Type Inference" href="http://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2014/08/12/clean-coding-in-swift-type-inference/" target="_blank">op-ed onÂ clean coding in Swift focused on Type Inference</a>, I began by saying,

> Quick! Â Tell me! Â What is the Type of theÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetails</span>Â constant in this code example:
> 
> <pre class="toolbar:2 lang:swift decode:true">let birdDetails = birdDetailsFromStorage()</pre>
> 
> With no additionalÂ context to glean information from, the correct answer to the question is, &#8220;I have absolutely no clue&#8230;&#8221;

**But is that concluding assertionÂ _true_? Â Hmm&#8230;**

_I&#8217;m learning_, and as I&#8217;ve weighedÂ a recent Twitter conversation and thought on a <a title="Rob Napier Comment" href="http://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2014/08/12/clean-coding-in-swift-type-inference/#comment-1551252721" target="_blank">comment thread that Rob NapierÂ made</a> on the post quoted above, I&#8217;m compelled to expand a little on my first post on Type Inference as it relates to clean code in Swift.

SomethingÂ struck me as I readÂ <a title="Rob's Comment" href="http://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2014/08/12/clean-coding-in-swift-type-inference/#comment-1551252721" target="_blank">Rob&#8217;s comment</a>:Â  WhyÂ _wouldn&#8217;t_ I know the Type that would be inferred from what is returned byÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetailsFromStorage()</span>Â and assigned to <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetails</span>? Â Presumably, I named the function what I named it intentionally. Â The part I missed, was that ifÂ I had _designed_ well and created aÂ TypeÂ calledÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">BirdDetails</span> (say, a Struct as Rob proposed), then all of a sudden, an inference can be madeÂ by both the compiler _and_ a human that theÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetails</span>Â constant is&#8230; well&#8230; an instance ofÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">BirdDetails</span>. Â Imagine that!

To quote Rob (emphasis added):

> <span style="color: #3f4549;">Type inference should only be used when the result is unambiguous, but <strong>the best solution is to</strong> <strong>make the result unambiguous</strong>.</span>

Bingo. Â The _best_ solution is to _make_ the result unambiguous. Â You and I as code authors are in charge of the clarity or ambiguity of our code &#8211; it&#8217;s up to us toÂ _make_ the results of our function evaluations unambiguous.

When I named the functionÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetailsFromStorage()</span>, I heavily implied something about its return Type in the name. Â I even implied it in the name of the _constant_. Â I was expecting the return Type to be something that encapsulated whatever &#8220;bird details&#8221; are &#8211; I just didn&#8217;t realize it at the time (although it&#8217;s super obvious now)!

The very _name_Â of a thing setsÂ expectations for you and the readers of your code. Â It&#8217;s ourÂ job to set ourselvesÂ up for thatÂ expectation to be _fulfilled_! Â B<span style="color: #3f4549;">e predictable with the return Type of your functionsÂ for your own sake. Â AÂ function signature should be such that when you run acrossÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">birdDetailsFromStorage()</span>Â in some piece ofÂ code, you are able toÂ legitimately expectÂ it to return aÂ <span class="lang:swift decode:true  crayon-inline">BirdDetails</span>. Â </span>

<span style="color: #3f4549;">Using this predictable,Â </span>convention-based approach to give humans the right clues about what the compiler is going to computeÂ a Type to be makesÂ Type Inference a totallyÂ legitimate language feature to embrace for the sake of your code&#8217;s clarity and simplicity.

I&#8217;ll leave you with a final quote from Rob&#8217;s comments:

> <span style="color: #3f4549;">Don&#8217;t go implying that you&#8217;re returning one thing when you&#8217;re returning another. If you must, then yes, explicit types are your punishment. ğŸ˜€</span>

Thank you Rob for your insight and feedback. Â You can read more of Rob&#8217;s work at <a title="Rob Napier's Blog" href="http://robnapier.net" target="_blank">http://robnapier.net</a>.
