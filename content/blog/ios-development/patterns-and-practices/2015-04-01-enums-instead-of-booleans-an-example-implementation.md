This blog entry was inspired by [Objc.io&#8217;s snippet titled &#8220;Enums instead of Booleans&#8221;][1]. I really loved the clarity that using enumerations brought to even the simplest of examples that was presented in that snippet. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, check it out before continuing on!

Objc.io&#8217;s snippet focused primarily on the definition and _consumption_ of the enumeration values. What I&#8217;d like to focus on here is the implementation of the thing that _produces_ those values for the switch-case that will consume them later on.

### Example scenario

To put an example before us, consider the following scenario:

  * Suppose that we&#8217;re building an app that utilizes a subscription-style service to deliver premium content.
  * Special things, such as providing access to the premium content, need to happen in the app if the user is a Subscriber in good standing.
  * Other things need to happen, such as denial of access to the premium content, if the user _had_ a subscription, but it&#8217;s expired.
  * Finally, if the user has never had a subscription, we&#8217;d still like to deny access to the content, but perhaps offer them the opportunity to subscribe.

Using Objc.io&#8217;s idea as a springboard, we could program this in a couple of ways:

<a name="booleans" class="jump-target"></a>

### 1 &#8211; We could define a few boolean properties throughout that would indicate the user&#8217;s subscription status:

  * `isSubscriber`
  * `isSubscriptionExpired`
  * `isNonSubscriber`

What I find interesting about this approach is that it&#8217;s not clear, from looking at the properties, that they&#8217;re all mutually exclusive. Can I be a **subscriber** whose **subscription has expired**? If my **subscription expired**, am I a **non-subscriber**?

It could be that I&#8217;ve chosen poor names for the properties, but if I wanted to make clear that the statuses are mutually exclusive, there&#8217;s a better way to encapsulate them. Objc.io helpfully pointed us in the direction of that better encapsulation method. Yep&#8230; you got it: enumerations!

<a name="enums-instead" class="jump-target"></a>

### 2 &#8211; As the title of the blog entry signals, we could replace the booleans with an enumeration:

<pre class="lang:swift decode:true " >public enum SubscriberStatus {
    case CurrentSubscriber
    case ExpiredSubscriber
    case NonSubscriber
}</pre>

Immediately, this clarifies the mutually exclusive part. Enumerations, by definition, expose mutually exclusive values. By defining the `SubscriberStatus` enumeration, I&#8217;ve made clear that my intent is to have someone be _either_ a `CurrentSubscriber`, an `ExpiredSubscriber`, or a `NonSubscriber`, but not combinations of each.

Not only that, but rather than including complicated branching logic when I need to determine someone&#8217;s subscription status, I can simply switch-case over the enumeration possibilities and perform the appropriate behavior.

<pre class="lang:swift decode:true " >func checkSubscriberStatusForRegistrant(registrant: Registrant) {
    // We're coming to the definition of Registrant...
    // In fact, Registrant's implementation is the goal of this blog entry!

    switch (registrant.subscriberStatus) {
    case .CurrentSubscriber:
        showPremiumContent()
    case .ExpiredSubscriber:
        alertExpiredSubscription()
    case .NonSubscriber:
        offerSubscription()
    }
    
}</pre>

<a name="produce-enum-values" class="jump-target"></a>

### Producing the enumeration values

The one thing that left me scratching my head on at first was the part of the whole scheme that would _produce_ the enumeration values. In my example above, I&#8217;ve left out what the implementation of `Registrant` looks like.

When I&#8217;m consuming the enumeration values, I&#8217;m riding on the fact that `registrant.subscriberStatus` has some way of producing a correct `SubscriberStatus` for the registrant. But what does that look like? Well&#8230; here&#8217;s one possibility:

<pre class="lang:swift decode:true " >public struct Registrant {
    public var subscriberStatus: SubscriberStatus {
        get {
            if (noSubscriptionOnFile()) {
                return .NonSubscriber
            }
            
            if (subscriptionOverdueForPayment()) {
                return .ExpiredSubscriber
            }
            
            return .CurrentSubscriber
        }
    }
    
    private func noSubscriptionOnFile() -> Bool {
        // Do what needs to be done to check if the registrant has a subscription on file or not
    }
    
    private func subscriptionOverdueForPayment() -> Bool {
        // Do what needs to be done to check if the registrant's subscription is overdue for payment
    }
}</pre>

So as you can see, the thing that _produces_ the enumeration values _does_ have some `if`s and `Bool`s in it. I couldn&#8217;t really think of another way to do this. To simplify the readability of the `subscriberStatus` property&#8217;s implementation, I&#8217;ve abstracted the more complicated computational logic for figuring out whether or not a subscription is on file or if the registrant is overdue for payment into functions.

Even though we do still have some `Bool`s to deal with, what we&#8217;ve gained (in my opinion) is clarity on the consumption end. To me, it&#8217;s worth it to have the `Bool` logic buried in one spot so that throughout the rest of my app, I can deal with clear, understandable, enumeration values.
