# Course Outline

First, you'll see the tools and learn how to use SwiftUI to create single-screen applications with adaptive user interfaces that work on multiple devices. 

Next, you’ll learn how to bring your own style to a SwiftUI user interface by customizing its appearance. 

Finally, you'll explore working with data-driven controls and understand navigation options for multi-screen applications. 

When you’re finished with this course, you'll know current best practices, iOS architecture, and the most important ideas you need to feel comfortable bringing your developer skills into the iOS and Apple developer world.
