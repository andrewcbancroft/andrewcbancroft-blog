      <description>Following along with Steve Smith&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Your First ASP.NET 5 Application on a Mac&amp;#8221;, I found myself frustrated that, despite all my efforts, the simple little sample project I was trying to get running just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work due to a problem with restoring the project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies.

Retracing my steps I got ASP.NET installed on my Mac, and I even got a cool little template going using Yeoman.
I opened up my scaffolded project using Visual Studio Code, and began the dependency restore process.</description>
