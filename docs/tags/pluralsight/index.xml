      <description>Core Data is an extremely powerful framework for managing and persisting data on your users&amp;#8217; devices. And let&amp;#8217;s face it: saving data to your users&amp;#8217; devices is inevitable. The question is, which data management and persistence technology you use when the time comes for you to tackle this challenge?
I&amp;#8217;ve been hard at work on a new course for Pluralsight called &amp;#8220;Core Data Fundamentals with Swift&amp;#8220;, and the best news is that it&amp;#8217;s now LIVE in the Pluralsight library!</description>

      <description>Announcing &amp;#8211; New Pluralsight Course! I&amp;#8217;m excited to announce the publication of my new course for Pluralsight titled &amp;#8220;Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods&amp;#8221;!
Not a Pluralsight subscriber? I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out their plans. They&amp;#8217;ve even got a free trial! Being a Pluralsight subscriber has literally been the single most impactful influence on my growth as a developer apart from at-the-keyboard experience.
Our team at work uses Pluralsight as a major portion of our developer training efforts, so there&amp;#8217;s an idea to pitch to your boss if you don&amp;#8217;t want to purchase an individual subscription!</description>
