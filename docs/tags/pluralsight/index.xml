      <description>Core Data is an extremely powerful framework for managing and persisting data on your users&amp;rsquo; devices. And let&amp;rsquo;s face it: saving data to your users&amp;rsquo; devices is inevitable. The question is, which data management and persistence technology you use when the time comes for you to tackle this challenge?
&amp;ldquo;Core Data Fundamentals with Swift&amp;rdquo; will give you the essential skills you need to architect an app to use Core Data.</description>

      <description>Course Outline I try to get as practical as possible in the course. As you&amp;rsquo;re watching you&amp;rsquo;ll be &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;#8221; into a team of iOS developers, and you&amp;rsquo;ll explore the problems that CocoaPods can solve for you by watching the team struggle through not having a dependency manager, and then sharing in their victories as they bring in CocoaPods to ease that dependency management struggle.
The course is a progressive journey.</description>
