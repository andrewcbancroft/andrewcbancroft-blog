      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve all been there. Do a search on the topic of &amp;#8220;saving data in iOS&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;ll get dozens of search results mentioning at least six different frameworks and platforms, and a month’s worth of reading.
Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice to distill the possibilities down into just what you need in order to start down a path for persisting data in your app?
&amp;#8220;iOS Data Persistence: The Big Picture&amp;#8221; will be worth the hour of your time.</description>

      <description>Updated on July 15, 2017 &amp;#8211; Swift 3 
After having to piece together each step along the path of preparing to test receipt validation for iOS apps, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to combine everything into the following guide. Whether you&amp;#8217;re working to implement receipt validation for a new iOS app, or for an existing one, this walk-through should provide guidance to get you ready to work with receipts in your iOS application.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;#8217;m starting a series related to my journey in learning to develop iOS apps. As lightbulbs come on for me, I plan to write up what I&amp;#8217;m learning, if nothing else for my own reference. But I do hope my readers enjoy the discoveries I make along the way.
These first few blogs will be somewhat autobiographical, so hopefully I don&amp;#8217;t bore you to death. I&amp;#8217;ll try and make them quick.</description>
