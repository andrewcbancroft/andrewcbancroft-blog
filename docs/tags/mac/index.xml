      <description>Following along with Steve Smith&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Your First ASP.NET 5 Application on a Mac&amp;#8221;, I found myself frustrated that, despite all my efforts, the simple little sample project I was trying to get running just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work due to a problem with restoring the project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies.

Retracing my steps I got ASP.NET installed on my Mac, and I even got a cool little template going using Yeoman.
I opened up my scaffolded project using Visual Studio Code, and began the dependency restore process.</description>

      <description>As part of a ASP.Net Web API service that I&amp;rsquo;m co-developing, I have gotten familiar with the DotNetZip Library.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;re using it to gather up a set of requested files from network storage, package them in a zip archive, and stream them back to a client via a web application.
During testing, things worked great on Windows machines, but the moment we tested using a Mac, we ran into issues.</description>
