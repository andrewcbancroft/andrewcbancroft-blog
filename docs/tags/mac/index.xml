      <description>Following along with Steve Smith&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Your First ASP.NET 5 Application on a Mac&amp;#8221;, I found myself frustrated that, despite all my efforts, the simple little sample project I was trying to get running just wouldn&amp;#8217;t work due to a problem with restoring the project&amp;#8217;s dependencies.

      <description>As part of a ASP.Net Web API service that I&amp;#8217;m co-developing, I have gotten familiar with the DotNetZip Library.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;re using it to gather up a set of requested files from network storage, package them in a zip archive, and stream them back to a client via a web application.
During testing, things worked great on Windows machines, but the moment we tested using a Mac, we ran into issues.</description>
