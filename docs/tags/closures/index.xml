      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? If a programming language comes with a named feature, you can be pretty sure it was named that way for a reason. It&amp;rsquo;s a safe bet that the language designers were purposeful in their naming, so if you can figure out that essential &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rsquo;d they name it that?&amp;#8221; question, you might be that much closer to understanding the feature or concept.

Why &amp;ldquo;closure&amp;#8221;? Now the challenge: Actually figuring out the answer to that &amp;ldquo;Why?</description>

      <title>Why Do We Need to Annotate Escaping Closures in Swift?</title>

      <description>My last entry on escaping closures ended up having way more interaction than I anticipated! It goes to show that you never know what the impact of a piece of writing will have. But that&amp;rsquo;s a different story&amp;#8230; :]
Several readers commented here and on Medium with the question, &amp;ldquo;Why? Why do we need to mark escaping closures with @escaping?&amp;#8221;

Do it yourself, compiler! Observant minds looked at the compiler&amp;rsquo;s ability to say, &amp;ldquo;Hey!</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re mostly in the business of coding up closures to pass off to other functions as callbacks, you may not have run into the concept of an &amp;ldquo;escaping closure&amp;#8221; yet.
When you step out of the role of consuming other peoples&amp;rsquo; APIs in to the realm of creating your own (and you do this all the time!), this is where you&amp;rsquo;ll likely run into the concept of an &amp;ldquo;escaping closure&amp;#8221; in certain scenarios.</description>

      <description>While experimenting with a few things today, I experienced this compiler error:
 Variable used within its own initial value
 Let me describe the situation I was in&amp;#8230;
I was playing (in a playground, no less) with closures, trying to mimic some behavior that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently learned about in Scala. Essentially, I was trying to implement a factorial function as a closure, and I was trying to do it recursively (that is, without using a for/while loop).</description>
