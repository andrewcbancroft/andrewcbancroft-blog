      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve previously written about using enumerations in Swift to encapsulate special values that could end up falling into the &amp;#8220;magic string&amp;#8221; category if they were to simply be scattered in-line throughout your code. The primary example I proposed for such a &amp;#8220;magic string&amp;#8221; replacement was Storyboard Segue Identifiers. These special identifiers have such a specific purpose that felt to me like a natural fit to create a Type in the form of an enumeration (which I called SegueIdentifier) to group them all together in one place so that I could easily find them and modify them, should I ever need to do so.</description>
