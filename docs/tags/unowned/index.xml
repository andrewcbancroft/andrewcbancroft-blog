      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet that a good number of Swift developers struggle with the particulars of how strong, weak, and unowned affect the run-time behavior of their code. I, myself, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to give an explanation of the finer points of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) if my life depended on it.
I wanted to stop being unsure about the implications of typing one of those three words before variable / constant declarations, so I finally pulled up the Apple Documentation on ARC and began trying to digest the semantics.</description>
