      <description>The challenge when dealing with the presentation and handling of more than one UIActionSheet in a single View Controller is made clear by asking, &amp;ldquo;How am I going to tell which action sheet I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with so that I can handle the user&amp;rsquo;s choice appropriately?&amp;#8221;
Presumably, the user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with one of the action sheets will be different than the other(s), so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to think through how to distinguish between them, in order to respond to that interaction appropriately.</description>

      <title>Replace Magic Strings with Enumerations in Swift</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What can I do to avoid these &amp;#8216;magic strings&amp;rsquo; in my code?&amp;#8221; – This was the question I asked myself recently as I found myself in prepareForSegue comparing segue.segueIdentifier to in-line hard-coded Strings. This kind of in-line hard-coding of a String for comparison purposes is what I mean by &amp;ldquo;magic strings&amp;#8221; in this article. I knew this felt like a bad idea, but the solution to a cleaner option wasn&amp;rsquo;t readily apparent to me.</description>
