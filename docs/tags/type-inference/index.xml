      <description>In my recent op-ed on clean coding in Swift focused on Type Inference, I began by saying,
 Quick! Tell me! What is the Type of the birdDetails constant in this code example:
let birdDetails = birdDetailsFromStorage() With no additional context to glean information from, the correct answer to the question is, &amp;#8220;I have absolutely no clue&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
 But is that concluding assertion true? Hmm&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;m learning, and as I&amp;#8217;ve weighed a recent Twitter conversation and thought on a comment thread that Rob Napier made on the post quoted above, I&amp;#8217;m compelled to expand a little on my first post on Type Inference as it relates to clean code in Swift.</description>

      <description>Quick! Tell me! What is the Type of the birdDetails constant in this code example:
let birdDetails = birdDetailsFromStorage() With no additional context to glean information from, the correct answer to the question is, &amp;#8220;I have absolutely no clue&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Or is it?
&amp;#8220;Not fair!&amp;#8221;, you say. &amp;#8220;In the real world, I&amp;#8217;d have the ability to option-click and learn the type from a pop-up tooltip, or learn this information by inspection from XCode&amp;#8217;s utilities panel.</description>
