      <description>The challenge when dealing with the presentation and handling of more than one UIActionSheet in a single View Controller is made clear by asking, &amp;ldquo;How am I going to tell which action sheet I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with so that I can handle the user&amp;rsquo;s choice appropriately?&amp;#8221;
Presumably, the user&amp;rsquo;s interaction with one of the action sheets will be different than the other(s), so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to think through how to distinguish between them, in order to respond to that interaction appropriately.</description>
