      <description>Of the major design patterns that are prevalent in iOS development, delegation is one that appears quite often. For many developers entering app development for the iOS platform, dealing with delegates is a new concept. It certainly was for me.
In my analysis of NSNotificationCenter vs Delegation, I wrote some about delegation, but only in comparison to how NSNotificationCenter works. I haven&amp;#8217;t yet given delegation dedicated time and analysis, but I intend to do so now.</description>

      <description>In Fundamentals of NSNotificationCenter in Swift, a commenter asked me to elaborate on a response I&amp;#8217;d given to a dialog going on below the blog post. I had stated:
 If you need a more structured environment around your [instance]-to-[instance] communication, delegates &amp;#8230; are probably a better choice [than NSNotificationCenter].
 I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for some time since I responded with that comment. What do I mean when I say &amp;#8220;if you need a more structured environment&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; What does that even look like?</description>
