      <description>How often do we take an initial cursory look at some documentation, shake our heads and say, &amp;#8220;Ok, sure! Got it!&amp;#8221;, and then some time later get to the actual usage of that perceived understanding only to find out, &amp;#8220;Woah &amp;#8211; this is behaving differently than I expected! I wonder if the documentation says anything about this?!&amp;#8221;
A few discussions I&amp;#8217;ve had recently have prompted me to question what I thought I knew about Swift extensions.</description>

      <description>Did you know that you can make any Type (here meaning Class, Enumeration, or Struct), even already-existing ones that you don&amp;#8217;t have the source code for, adopt a protocol that it doesn&amp;#8217;t normally conform to out of the box?
You can &amp;#8211; even if you don&amp;#8217;t have the original source code for that Type! It&amp;#8217;s a powerful and intriguing proposition. Let&amp;#8217;s explore how this is possible.
How, you ask? Well, as the title of this article suggests, Swift extensions are the way to do it.</description>
