      <description>Without fail, any time Rob Napier (@cocoaphony) speaks or writes, I gain insight into new and deeper ways to solve problems with Swift.
In January 2016, he gave a talk at dotSwift, and I wanted to record my thoughts on something he said that made a lot of sense when it comes to the topic of, &amp;#8220;Should I create and adopt a protocol for this Type I&amp;#8217;m creating, or should I just pass it a function instead?</description>

      <description>Being a C# developer by day and a Swift developer by night has me constantly thinking about the similarities and differences between these two languages. I genuinely enjoy programming with each, and I love it when I can take a strategy that works well in one language, and see where that might cross over to the other. One of the areas I&amp;#8217;ve been pondering as of late is the idea of how Swift and C# compare in terms of protocol extensions and abstract classes.</description>

      <description>Did you know that you can make any Type (here meaning Class, Enumeration, or Struct), even already-existing ones that you don&amp;#8217;t have the source code for, adopt a protocol that it doesn&amp;#8217;t normally conform to out of the box?
You can &amp;#8211; even if you don&amp;#8217;t have the original source code for that Type! It&amp;#8217;s a powerful and intriguing proposition. Let&amp;#8217;s explore how this is possible.
How, you ask? Well, as the title of this article suggests, Swift extensions are the way to do it.</description>
