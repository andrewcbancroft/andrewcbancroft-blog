      <description>Announcing &amp;#8211; New Pluralsight Course! I&amp;#8217;m excited to announce the publication of my new course for Pluralsight titled &amp;#8220;Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods&amp;#8221;!
Not a Pluralsight subscriber? I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out their plans. They&amp;#8217;ve even got a free trial! Being a Pluralsight subscriber has literally been the single most impactful influence on my growth as a developer apart from at-the-keyboard experience.
Our team at work uses Pluralsight as a major portion of our developer training efforts, so there&amp;#8217;s an idea to pitch to your boss if you don&amp;#8217;t want to purchase an individual subscription!</description>

      <description>While relying on 3rd party dependencies can provide you the benefit of not having to spend time implementing a portion of your app, realize that you’re essentially giving away little pieces of your app when you bring in a dependency.
You’re delegating away a certain level of control off to someone else who has no knowledge of or interest in the final outcome of your team’s app.
Adding dependencies to your project doesn’t come without cost, so it’s best to count that cost up front in order to make sure it’s a good idea to pursue this option.</description>
