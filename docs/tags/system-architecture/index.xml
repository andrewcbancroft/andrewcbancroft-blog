      <description>Every function; every class; every struct and enum and protocol is an API.
YOU &amp;#8212; are an API designer As developers, we move into and out of the role of &amp;ldquo;API Designer&amp;#8221; constantly.
Have you ever thought about that? You are an API designer! You create Application Programming Interfaces all the time.
I believe that everything we create has design built in, whether we&amp;rsquo;ve thought much about it or not.</description>
