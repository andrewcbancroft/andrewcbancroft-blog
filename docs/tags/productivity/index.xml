      <description>Away with the Phone! Put your phone away. Far away.
Not in your pocket.
Not on your desk.
In a drawer &amp;#8211; away from you.
Disconnect.
You should be able to tell if you&amp;#8217;ve got an emergency call coming in, but past that, aim to be completely oblivious to every other kind of notification flowing into your smart device.
If you use a time management technique like Pomodoro (there are plenty of timers and apps in the app store to keep you on track with this strategy), you get 5 minutes every half hour to pause from making awesome stuff.</description>
