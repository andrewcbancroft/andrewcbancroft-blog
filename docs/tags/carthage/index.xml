      <description>The old adage &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t go reinventing the wheel&amp;#8221; comes into play often when developing software, doesn&amp;#8217;t it? Why build this [thing] ourselves when someone else has invented it already?
Fantastic libraries and frameworks exist out there to assist developers with common and sometimes even difficult problems. Whether it be an easier-to-use abstraction over the networking stack with AFNetworking or AlamoFire, or adding a popular behavior-driven development testing framework like Quick to our workflow, we find ourselves constantly wanting to be able to take advantage of the things that others are doing in the community so we don&amp;#8217;t have to invent that wheel again ourselves.</description>
