      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about Immutable Types and Changing State in Swift, where I hoped to convey an &amp;ldquo;aha!-moment&amp;#8221; that happened for me.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a bit more. For example, the technique I presented for transforming instances of a Type immutably actually come for free when you use a value Type, such as a Struct! Check out @NatashaTheRobot&amp;rsquo;s writeup on the subject, titled &amp;ldquo;Mutating Functions in Swift Structs&amp;#8221;, for more information.</description>

      <description>Dabble in Swift for long and the functional programming paradigm will most certainly appear on your radar. From conferences to books to blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot in the functional programming arena as it relates to Swift.
As I seek to improve my functional programming thought processes and to practice what I&amp;rsquo;m learning, I found myself struggling with a fundamental concept: immutability. Especially when I&amp;rsquo;m designing something that, at the very least, appears to require the ability to change state at some point in time.</description>
