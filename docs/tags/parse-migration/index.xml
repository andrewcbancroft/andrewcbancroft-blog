      <description>It&amp;#8217;s always the little things that lead to flatter foreheads (or at least it is for me).
Banging my head against the desk this evening working on a Parse migration, I finally figured out what was causing an error condition in a PFCloud function call.
The request to the server succeeded, but the response was malformed somehow:
 Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840 &amp;#8220;JSON text did not start with array or object and option to allow fragments not set.</description>

      <description>The Parse migration process has begun &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of small apps that used this backend as a service because the backend was simple and Parse was free.
The migration has gone fairly smooth so far, but I hit a wall and have been struggling to figure out the solution for about 3 hours. 3 hours too many, haha!
