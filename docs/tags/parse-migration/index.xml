      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always the little things that lead to flatter foreheads (or at least it is for me).
Banging my head against the desk this evening working on a Parse migration, I finally figured out what was causing an error condition in a PFCloud function call.
The request to the server succeeded, but the response was malformed somehow:
 Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3840 &amp;ldquo;JSON text did not start with array or object and option to allow fragments not set.</description>

      <description>Below are steps that I&amp;rsquo;ve taken, myself, to deploy the Parse Dashboard to a cloud host, such as Azure, or Heroku.
Before you worry with a cloud host, you need a copy of the parse-dashboard to prepare for deployment&amp;#8230;

1 – Clone parse-dashboard git repository First, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to clone (or fork, then clone) the parse-dashboard git repository from GitHub.
I typically make folders in my ~/Developer directory for projects that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.</description>

      <description>The Parse migration process has begun – I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of small apps that used this backend as a service because the backend was simple and Parse was free.
The migration has gone fairly smooth so far, but I hit a wall and have been struggling to figure out the solution for about 3 hours. 3 hours too many, haha!

Problem Overview Any time I did a query in my Parse Cloud Code, the query would fail.</description>
