      <description>I&amp;#8217;m very excited to announce that my new app, 10 Read 10 Said, is now available for iOS and Android!
While the goal of the app is to help you implement the &amp;#8220;10 Read 10 Said&amp;#8221; strategy for memorizing Bible verses, my goal in this article is to dissect the app, and share with you how some of the major features were implemented.
As it turns out, most of the major features of the app are things that I&amp;#8217;ve already written about over the past year of producing Swift content!</description>
