      <description>I hit the &amp;#8220;No bundle url present.&amp;#8221; roadblock today and had to dig a bit to find the solution. I&amp;#8217;m going to describe how I encountered the problem, and provide the solution that&amp;#8217;s worked more than once for me, ever since I found the suggestion in the React Native GitHub repository.
