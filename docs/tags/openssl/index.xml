      <description>Updated on July 15, 2017 â€“ Swift 3 
So you&amp;rsquo;ve prepared to test receipt validation by setting up your app in iTunes Connect.
You&amp;rsquo;ve brought in a cryptography library like OpenSSL to be able to work with the PKCS #7 container that acts as the &amp;ldquo;envelope&amp;#8221; for the receipt. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve even done it the &amp;ldquo;easy way&amp;#8221; with CocoaPods.
You&amp;rsquo;ve located and loaded the receipt for validation.
Now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to extract the PKCS #7 container and work with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on outfitting an app I&amp;rsquo;m working on to be able to validate receipts to verify purchases of the app.
Little did I know, this adventure would introduce the need to understand how to use cryptography in order to work with the receipt.

Cryptography library needed In order to even &amp;ldquo;open&amp;#8221; the receipt itself, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to work with something called a &amp;ldquo;PKCS #7 container&amp;#8221;. Once we get the container open, we need to be able to validate Apple&amp;rsquo;s certificate that they use to sign every purchase of every app.</description>
