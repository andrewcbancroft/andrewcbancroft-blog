      <description>Data management applications, by which I mean an app where you&amp;#8217;re allowing users to add, edit, and delete bits of data as part of your app&amp;#8217;s core function, very likely use a table view (or two) to visualize lists of information that users of the app can interact with.
Making changes to the information listed in the table view and signaling those changes in a fluent way becomes a top concern for these types of apps.</description>
