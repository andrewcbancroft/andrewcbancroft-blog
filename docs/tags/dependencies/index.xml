      <description>While relying on 3rd party dependencies can provide you the benefit of not having to spend time implementing a portion of your app, realize that you’re essentially giving away little pieces of your app when you bring in a dependency.
You’re delegating away a certain level of control off to someone else who has no knowledge of or interest in the final outcome of your team’s app.
Adding dependencies to your project doesn’t come without cost, so it’s best to count that cost up front in order to make sure it’s a good idea to pursue this option.</description>
