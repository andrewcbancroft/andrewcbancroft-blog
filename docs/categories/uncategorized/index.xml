      <description>Away with the Phone! Put your phone away. Far away.
Not in your pocket.
Not on your desk.
In a drawer – away from you.
Disconnect.
You should be able to tell if you&amp;rsquo;ve got an emergency call coming in, but past that, aim to be completely oblivious to every other kind of notification flowing into your smart device.

      <description>Open iTunes. (optional) Import any songs you&amp;rsquo;d like to make clips for. Select (click) the song that you&amp;rsquo;d like a sound clip for so that it&amp;rsquo;s the only one selected. Right-click that song and select &amp;ldquo;Get Info&amp;#8221;. A window will appear – Click &amp;ldquo;Options&amp;#8221; to access the screen to set your start and stop times. Check the boxes next to &amp;ldquo;Start Time&amp;#8221; and &amp;ldquo;Stop Time&amp;#8221;. Enter a start time in the text box next to &amp;ldquo;Start Time&amp;#8221;.</description>
