      <description>Today I was running into a mysterious error in DataStage as I was running a sequence job.&amp;nbsp; Things seemed to be going well until one of my Fact jobs at the end of the sequence reported “Aborted” in DataStage Director.&amp;nbsp; Looking into the log for this job revealed a rather vague error message:
[StageName] DB2 function SQLFetch failed:&amp;nbsp; SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -1,042: Msg = [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/LINUXX8664] SQL1042C&amp;nbsp; An unexpected system error occurred.</description>

      <description>I just spent the majority of my morning trying to figure out why in the world my range lookup kept failing.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully this will save you some time in troubleshooting your range lookup failures.&amp;nbsp; To cut right to the chase, my resolution involved sorting my reference source prior to doing the lookup.&amp;nbsp; Adding a sort stage with the appropriate sort keys prior to doing the lookup solved my problem.&amp;nbsp; I probably learned this in a training at some point, but I just didn’t retain it.</description>
