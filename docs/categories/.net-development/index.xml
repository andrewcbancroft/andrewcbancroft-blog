      <title>Every Developer is an API Designer</title>

      <description>Every function; every class; every struct and enum and protocol is an API.
YOU &amp;#8212; are an API designer As developers, we move into and out of the role of &amp;#8220;API Designer&amp;#8221; constantly.
Have you ever thought about that? You are an API designer! You create Application Programming Interfaces all the time.
I believe that everything we create has design built in, whether we&amp;#8217;ve thought much about it or not.</description>

      <title>TypeScript Build Errors When Publishing ASP.Net Web Project</title>

      <description>I had TypeScript files building and running perfectly when I&amp;#8217;d debug locally, but when I changed over to publish the project, I got build errors galore:
 Cannot find module ___
TS6053 &amp;#8211; File ___ not found
 I had forgotten that I set up my TypeScript Build configuration for Debug, but I hadn&amp;#8217;t changed anything for the Release configuration in Visual Studio.
Obviously, that would produce different build results, right?</description>

      <title>Using PowerShell to Install a DLL into the GAC</title>

      <description>A couple of ways exist to install a DLL into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). Using gacutil.exe is one, but this comes as part of a Visual Studio installation, and in a server environment, you may not have the luxury of installing Visual Studio, just to get the utility installed.
An alternative, however, is to use PowerShell to install the DLL into the GAC. The following code snippet should take care of your needs.</description>

      <description>Following along with Steve Smith&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Your First ASP.NET 5 Application on a Mac&amp;#8221;, I found myself frustrated that, despite all my efforts, the simple little sample project I was trying to get running just wouldn&amp;#8217;t work due to a problem with restoring the project&amp;#8217;s dependencies.

      <title>Testing is to Software as Experiment is to Science</title>

      <description>The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment.
The sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.
 These quote came from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of the Feynman Lectures on Physics.
I&amp;#8217;m not a physicist, but the software developer in me resonated with the connection between experimentation and validation of what we know about the world around us.</description>

      <title>Up and Running with Unity IOC Container for ASP.Net MVC</title>

      <description>The process for creating an ASP.Net MVC web application that relies on the Unity Inversion of Control (IOC) container has gotten quite a bit more streamlined since I first started working with it.&amp;nbsp; However, since I don’t start brand new software projects often, it’s often the case that it takes me a few minutes to figure out which NuGet package to install to get things up and running.&amp;nbsp;
The following is a quick-reference for myself, and for anyone else who’s interested in getting up and running quickly with the Unity IOC container for an ASP.</description>

      <title>Date, Date?, and the ToString Method in VB.Net</title>

      <description>I just spent the last 45 minutes frustrated as to why I was getting the following exception

&amp;#8220;Input string was not in a correct format.&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;[InvalidCastException: Conversion from string &amp;#8220;MMMM dd, yyyy&amp;#8221; to type &amp;#8216;Integer&amp;#8217; is not valid.]
I kept thinking to myself, &amp;#8220;How hard can this possibly be?!! I&amp;#8217;ve done this a thousand times &amp;#8212; Why is it wanting to convert my format string into an Integer?</description>

      <description>I recently hit a road bump when developing a NuGet package. Mid-way through making the package, I decided I wanted to include couple of transforms to add some default connection strings to an app.config or a web.config file. Try as I may, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get NuGet to apply the transforms to my project&amp;#8217;s web.config file even though I was following NuGet documentation&amp;#8217;s instructions to a tee.
It turns out that my problem was related to about 3 things all working together in tandem to defeat me:</description>

      <description>As part of a ASP.Net Web API service that I&amp;#8217;m co-developing, I have gotten familiar with the DotNetZip Library.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;re using it to gather up a set of requested files from network storage, package them in a zip archive, and stream them back to a client via a web application.
During testing, things worked great on Windows machines, but the moment we tested using a Mac, we ran into issues.</description>
