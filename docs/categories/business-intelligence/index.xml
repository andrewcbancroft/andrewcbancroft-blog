During our configuration of Reporting Services for SharePoint I ran into another common issue.
I consulted MSDN once again and followed the directions given at this MSDN article. Even after following all these instructions, when I would attempt to create a new BI Semantic Model Connection in the SharePoint library, I would receive the following error:
Cannot connect to the server or database.</description>

      <description>I recently worked with our SharePoint administrator to install SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services in SharePoint Integrated Mode to take advantage of PowerView. By following the installation instructions found at this MSDN article, we were able to painlessly install both Reporting Services and the Reporting Services Add-in from the SQL Server installation media.
Then began the configuration process. Since everyone&amp;#8217;s environment is different, I found it difficult to troubleshoot some of the odd behavior that we were running in to.</description>

      <description>This past week I had the opportunity to attend Microsoft TechEd 2012. Lots and lots of great material presented &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m pretty stoked about some of the amazing features of SQL Server 2012&amp;#8217;s BI stack.
During the course of the week I discovered something that has been emerging in my thought process for a while, but sort of hit the level of practicality as I saw one particular feature demonstrated: the BI Semantic Model.</description>
