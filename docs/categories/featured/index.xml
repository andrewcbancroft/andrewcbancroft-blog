      <description>Course Outline I try to get as practical as possible in the course. As you&amp;rsquo;re watching you&amp;rsquo;ll be &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;#8221; into a team of iOS developers, and you&amp;rsquo;ll explore the problems that CocoaPods can solve for you by watching the team struggle through not having a dependency manager, and then sharing in their victories as they bring in CocoaPods to ease that dependency management struggle.
The course is a progressive journey.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve researched Test Driven Development practices in general, and for iOS / Mac applications, I&amp;rsquo;ve been helped by several sources. I&amp;rsquo;ve also discovered a few things the hard way, so I&amp;rsquo;m combining and maintaining this list of resources to help point you in some helpful directions as you adventure in unit testing your iOS apps.
