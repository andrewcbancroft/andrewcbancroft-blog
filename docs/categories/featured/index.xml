      <description>Announcing &amp;#8211; New Pluralsight Course! I&amp;#8217;m excited to announce the publication of my new course for Pluralsight titled &amp;#8220;Managing Xcode Project Dependencies with CocoaPods&amp;#8221;!
Not a Pluralsight subscriber? I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out their plans. They&amp;#8217;ve even got a free trial! Being a Pluralsight subscriber has literally been the single most impactful influence on my growth as a developer apart from at-the-keyboard experience.
Our team at work uses Pluralsight as a major portion of our developer training efforts, so there&amp;#8217;s an idea to pitch to your boss if you don&amp;#8217;t want to purchase an individual subscription!</description>

      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve researched Test Driven Development practices in general, and for iOS / Mac applications, I&amp;#8217;ve been helped by several sources. I&amp;#8217;ve also discovered a few things the hard way, so I&amp;#8217;m combining and maintaining this list of resources to help point you in some helpful directions as you adventure in unit testing your iOS apps.
