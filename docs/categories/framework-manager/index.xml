      <description>When installing Framework Manager 10.1 and attempting to use it for the first time, things went down hill nearly immediately. I made sure to install a copy of the DB2 client on my development machine, but I still ran into issues connecting to data sources in Framework Manager.
For those who need to install a DB2 client, IBM provides those downloads here for DB2 10.1. For other versions, you can go here.</description>
