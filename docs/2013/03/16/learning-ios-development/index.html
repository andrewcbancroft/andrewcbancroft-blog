<p>Today I&#8217;m starting a series related to my journey in learning to develop iOS apps. As lightbulbs come on for me, I plan to write up what I&#8217;m learning, if nothing else for my own reference. But I do hope my readers enjoy the discoveries I make along the way.</p>

<p>These first few blogs will be somewhat autobiographical, so hopefully I don&#8217;t bore you to death. I&#8217;ll try and make them quick. More technical stuff will appear very soon. I thought to write a short article about how I got started. If I had an &#8220;In the beginning&#8230;&#8221; moment, what would that be?</p>

<h2 id="the-early-days">The Early Days</h2>

<p>It seems like just yesterday I was a little boy visiting my Grandpa&#8217;s house in Lawton, OK, eager to play on Grandpa&#8217;s computer. Computers in the early 90&#8217;s were still not quite the commodity they are in 2013. We didn&#8217;t own one yet, but <em>Grandpa</em> did.</p>

<p>If I had to point to an &#8220;In the beginning&#8230;&#8221; stage, it&#8217;d be the times when Grandpa sat down with me and taught me about computers. Not just games (although I did enjoy Submarine and Wheel of Fortune for DOS a <em>lot</em>) &#8211; he taught me the basics of how to instruct a computer.  He taught me to program. He was a Master of DOS and a QBasic Guru. If I had to guess, he still prefers elements of both today. :]</p>

<p>He is, quite simply, an amazing man. He is now a retired entrepreneur, but when he was running his music store there were always those &#8220;things that needed to be done&#8221;.  He viewed the &#8220;gotta do it&#8217;s&#8221; as an opportunity to automate by programming a computer to do it <em>for</em> __him, rather than do it by hand. He&#8217;s showed me how he programmed apps to produce his financial statements, track his budget, print invoices, and all kinds of other &#8220;by hand&#8221; stuff that he was able to make &#8220;automagically&#8221; with a computer. It was (and still is) fascinating to me.</p>

<p>In addition to those early years of influence, I&#8217;ve learned from Grandpa that even though &#8220;there&#8217;s an app for that&#8221; already, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;ll work for you how you want it to work. Grandpa could be happy with 99% of an app&#8217;s functionality, but there&#8217;d always be that <em>one thing</em> that bugged him. What did he do? He wrote his own. He made it work how <em>he</em> wanted it to work. He may not have been inventing a new wheel every time, but because he could program, he could improve the existing wheel to his liking.</p>

<p>All of this has served to motivate me in my pursuit of programming in general.  I love my Grandpa.  My Grandpa loves computers.  The little kid inside of me is yelling, &#8220;Me too!  Me too!&#8221; to this day.</p>

<p>My Grandpa just turned 81 and he still loves the computing world.  It&#8217;s been great fun to watch him use his latest computer: his iPhone.  It&#8217;s been even <em>more</em> fun to show him the little apps I&#8217;m making as I learn to program for iOS.</p>

<p>Next up will be a post on how I&#8217;ve approached learning to program for iOS.  What&#8217;s my strategy and how is it going so far?  See you again soon with all that and more.</p>
