<p>Nothing I publish is perfect.</p>
<p>Everything I publish is a "work in progress" to some degree or another.</p>
<p>I once wrote about <a href="https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2014/11/20/agile-blogging/" rel="nofollow">Agile Blogging</a>.  My thought was, "What if I could incrementally build up content, rather than have to sit down and write until <em>all</em> my thoughts were <em>fully</em> fleshed out and 'perfect'?  What would that look like?"</p>
<p>I took some queues from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" rel="nofollow">Agile software development methodology</a>, and decided that I'd value continual enhancement and gradual build-up of my content, over and above long time commitments and perfection.</p>
<p>I'd focus on rapid delivery of useful information, even if it's only useful to <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>I'd make iterative improvements to what I publish, rather than waiting until it was "completely done" and "without flaw" (because when would it ever be, anyway??).</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes what I pubish is rough.  <em>Really</em> rough.  Like... only an outline of the headers, or half-baked in terms of complete thoughts.</p>
<p>Lest you wonder "What's up with this guy??", I've got this page to give you a heads-up on what's going on.</p>
<p><strong>When I'm actively in the process of improving a particular article</strong>, you may notice the "work in progess" notice at the top. It'll land you right here so you know, "Oh... okay... this isn't 'finished' yet".</p>
<p>On the flip side, just because I remove the "work in progress" notice from an article, it doesn't mean my I think my work is perfect.  It just means I've moved on, and am not <em>actively</em> working on it.</p>
<p>I'm always open to suggestions for improvement, and <a href="https://github.com/andrewcbancroft/datadaylife-blog">since this site is hosted on GitHub</a> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/andrewcbancroft/datadaylife-blog/tree/master/_posts">posts</a> directory), you're welcome to send pull requests (I'd love that)!
